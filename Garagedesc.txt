The garage is a utilitarian space marked by its distinctive, industrial feel. As you step inside, the faint but unmistakable odor of gasoline hangs in the air, mingling with the sharper scent of electrical components. The buzz of electric charges hums softly in the background, adding to the room’s mechanical ambiance.

The garage is neatly organized, though its primary function is evident. A sleek, high-end car is parked inside, its polished exterior catching the faint light from a single overhead bulb. The vehicle is securely locked, a clear indication that it is not intended for casual access. The car’s presence adds a sense of both importance and exclusivity to the space.

As you move around the garage, you become aware of a subtle yet unmistakable shift in the environment: a camera mounted in a corner of the room begins to activate. Its distinctive whirring sound is a telltale sign that it’s now online, its lens tracking your movements with precise, unblinking focus. This surveillance measure underscores the restricted nature of the garage; rejuvenators are not permitted here unsupervised, and every corner of the space is under close watch.

The combination of mechanical sounds, the lingering smell of fuel, and the watchful eye of the camera creates an atmosphere that is both functional and monitored, ensuring that the garage remains a secure and controlled environment.
