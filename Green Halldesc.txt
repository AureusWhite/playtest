Green Hall is a vibrant and welcoming corridor that embodies its name with a soothing palette of green and blue hues. The walls are painted in calming shades of green, interspersed with touches of blue that create a refreshing and tranquil atmosphere. These colors are not just decorative but serve a functional purpose, guiding rejuvenators on their way to school and indicating a space that is both accessible and inclusive.

The hall is lined with an array of doors, each one standing ajar to signify their constant accessibility. These doors lead to various rooms and facilities that rejuvenators may use throughout the day. The open nature of these doors is a deliberate choice, reflecting the hall's role as a hub of activity and interaction. Unlike many other areas in the building, Green Hall is one of the few places where rejuvenators are allowed to roam freely, regardless of the time of day.

Soft lighting illuminates the corridor, casting a warm glow that enhances the calming effect of the green and blue color scheme. The floor is covered in a durable yet attractive tile, patterned in a subtle, geometric design that complements the walls and adds to the hall's inviting ambiance.

The occasional sound of footsteps and distant chatter fills the space, reinforcing the hall's role as a central and active thoroughfare. Green Hall is more than just a passageway; itâ€™s a lively and accessible area that facilitates the daily routines of rejuvenators, providing a sense of openness and freedom within the structured environment of the building.
