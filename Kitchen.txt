A wall of steam hits you as hard as the sounds that begin to crash in your ears, dishes unbreakable as they are they still make a racket on the tile floor and accidents happen, through this a high piched voice shouts encourragemnt and honest critique with kid gloves, the Rejuves here snap to action at her beck and call. If she notices you just standing here, best case senario you get thrown out, worse case... Dishes.
