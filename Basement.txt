The basement is off-limits and mainly used for storage. Itâ€™s not a place where rejuves are allowed to roam freely.The floor is dustly and concrete, the noises of the furnice and boilers guggling, banging and bumping make you jump a little.

Not much down here, a door to the old root cellar is locked with a large padlock and a poster at the base of the stairs remind rejuves that this isn't a place for play.

The general attitude surrounding this place is get what you need and get back up stairs, this room does not have a lightswitch and is always lit up. The stairs are designed to catch a falling body this is often trigged accidentally going up or down to quickly resulting a net being brought up that takes time to retract and brings an awful lot of attention from staff, the upstairs are the same, best not to play on the stairs anyways.
