This softly blue lit room features a few chairs for those who supervise the rejuves here, along the walls are changing tables, one is lower and has a step stool. one does not and it taller. the floor is hard and cold on bare feet so there are socks left out for those who have bare feet and or just need socks. uniform underpants and diapers are also on the same shelf.

The ventilation fan echos around the room giving the air buzz to it, the sent of stirile suggests this room is cleaned often but not often enough to disguise the smell of a dirty diaper. Much like the rest of the blue areas if you remain here too long the lights will go out as the sensers are at adult hight but won't turn off if your on a changing table. When they do the LEDs arounf the door glow green and the door unlocks and pops open.
