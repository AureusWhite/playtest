As you enter the dormitory, you’re greeted by a spacious room filled with an array of bunk beds arranged in orderly rows, each extending off in different directions. The walls are adorned with whimsical, colorful murals depicting rejuvenators at various stages of their growth. At the forefront of each row, the first bed showcases a playful caricature of a rejuvenator at a younger age. These beds feature crinkly plastic mattresses and plain white sheets, while the cheerful illustration on the bedpost depicts a tiny rejuvenator in a diaper, giving a thumbs-up with an endearing grin.

Moving further into the room, you’ll notice that older children have their own designated sections. Their bunks are adorned with vibrant, colorful sheets that add a touch of individuality and personality to their sleeping spaces. Above these beds, illustrations show an older rejuvenator in cozy pajamas, caught mid-yawn with a sleepy but content expression. The separation by sections helps to subtly define the different age groups, creating a sense of order and comfort tailored to each stage of childhood. The soft hum of the building’s central ventilation system and the faint rustling of sheets create a soothing ambiance, making the dorms a welcoming haven for rest after a day of activity.
