The front yard is a meticulously maintained space that serves as the primary threshold between the campus and the outside world. A robust, imposing fence encircles the area, its tall, wrought-iron bars standing as a formidable barrier against any unwelcome visitors. The fence is adorned with intricate patterns and topped with decorative finials, reflecting the seriousness of its role in securing the premises.

Unlike the other areas within the campus, the front yard is closely monitored. A series of discreetly mounted cameras are positioned along the perimeter of the fence, their lenses focused outward with a vigilant eye. These cameras serve as a constant watch, ensuring that no unauthorized individuals can breach the campusâ€™s boundaries. Their presence is a stark reminder of the controlled environment and the importance of security.

The yard itself is neatly landscaped, with well-manicured lawns and carefully tended flower beds that add a touch of serenity to the otherwise guarded space. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet vigilance, with the surrounding greenery contrasting sharply against the imposing security measures. The gentle rustle of leaves in the breeze and the occasional chirp of birds provide a subtle backdrop to the otherwise tranquil but closely monitored front yard.
