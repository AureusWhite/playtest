Garden: The school garden is a lush, green haven where imagination and safety play hand in hand. The soft grass tickles your toes as you explore the colorful, safety-minded play equipment. Swing on the sturdy swings, climb the gentle slides, and enjoy the merry-go-round that spins just right—not too fast, not too slow. It’s a perfect spot for laughter, adventure, and making new friends under the warm sun.
