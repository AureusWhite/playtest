Front Yard: The front yard is the welcoming entrance to the school, bordered by a sturdy fence and monitored by cameras to keep any unwelcome visitors at bay. While it's generally safe, it's always best not to talk to strangers. The well-maintained path leads to the school doors, inviting you in for another day of learning and adventure.
The front yard features a lemonade stand and serves as the entryway to the school. Cameras monitor everything, and opening the gate triggers an alarm.
