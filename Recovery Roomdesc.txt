The Recovery Room is a serene and comforting space designed to help rejuvenators ease back into their daily routine after the rejuvenation procedure. As you look around, it's clear that this room prioritizes comfort and reassurance.

The room is softly lit by warm, ambient lighting that creates a soothing atmosphere, perfect for rest and relaxation. The bed, where you woke up, is still in a state of disarray from your previous use, with the sheets rumpled and the pillows slightly askew. It appears that no one else is scheduled for rejuvenation at the moment, leaving the space in a tranquil and unoccupied state.

Against one wall, there are neatly organized shelves stocked with uniforms. These are neatly folded and available for rejuvenators to change into once they are ready. The uniforms are simple yet comfortable, ensuring that rejuvenators can transition smoothly from the recovery period to their regular activities.

In addition to the uniforms, a special touch in the room is the box of “Busy Beavers” themed stuffed animals. This box is brimming with an assortment of plush beavers, each one decorated in a playful and charming manner. These stuffed animals are designed for cuddling and comfort, providing a sense of security and warmth. You’re free to choose one to hold or even take one with you as a comforting companion.

The Recovery Room’s decor is gentle and unobtrusive, with soft colors and plush furnishings that enhance the feeling of calm and safety. It’s a place meant to offer both physical comfort and emotional reassurance, making it a perfect environment for rejuvenators to recover and reorient before returning to their usual activities.
