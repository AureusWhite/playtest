<h3>Introduction and Prologue:</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px; color: #511e6e;"> In a not-so-distant future, a groundbreaking technology was developed that could revert cells into stem cells, effectively 'rejuvenating' the body. This miraculous advancement, however, came at a significant cost—wars were waged, and many lives were lost in its pursuit.

Ultimately, peace was restored through the United Nations of Earth's (UNE) ruling, which mandated that rejuvenation technology be made available to every person, free of charge. Yet, with this newfound functional immortality, society faced unforeseen challenges. The concept of prison, designed to subtract from a finite lifetime, lost its deterrent effect. With the ability to rejuvenate at will, incarceration became an obsolete punishment.

A peculiar solution emerged: prisoners and other undesirables were reduced in size and 'cycled' back into childhood rather than being confined to jails. This approach made them easier to house and feed. However, overpopulation quickly became a pressing issue, requiring delicate management to avoid infringing on individual rights. As part of the UNE's ruling, the rejuvenation treatment included a mechanism to inhibit maturity until individuals proved themselves capable of living adult lives. One of the many consequences of this was a lack of naturally born children.</p>
<h1>Society found its missing 'children' in us, the rejuvenated.</h1>

<p style="font-size: 16px; color: #511e6e;">This led to yet another complex problem: the rights of the rejuvenated to resume their previous adult activities. When individuals regained their adult memories within immature brains, the results were mixed, to say the least. Initially, rejuvenated adults were allowed to continue their lives with minimal restrictions. However, this policy soon proved disastrous, as the combination of undeveloped frontal lobes and fragmented procedural memories led to numerous accidents. For instance, an eight-year-old with the skills of a former race car driver was still prone to reckless driving. As a result, the rights and privileges of rejuvenated individuals were systematically stripped away. Each new incident led to the removal of yet another adult privilege.

These restrictions were implemented with varying degrees of justification—some were necessary, while others seemed arbitrary. Over time, rejuvenated individuals, or 'rejuves,' began to be treated more like children, especially since genuine children became a rarity due to overpopulation. Despite these changes, it is crucial to remember that we, the rejuvenated, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. Our right to be seen as more than just children must be upheld, regardless of the societal shifts that have accompanied our extended lifespans.
