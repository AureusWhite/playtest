The Red Hall is the administrative hub of the facility. If a rejuve finds themselves here, it's usually because they are meeting with the staff for important reasons, be it for commendation or correction. The hall is lined with office doors and has a more formal, business-like atmosphere compared to the playful areas of the facility. This area serves as the bridge between rejuves and the administrative staff, ensuring that all needs and issues are addressed efficiently.
