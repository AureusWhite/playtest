Stepping onto the roof, you immediately feel the heat radiating from the asphalt surface beneath your feet. The texture of the roof is rough and sticky, causing a peeling sound with each step as the asphalt clings stubbornly to your shoes. It’s clear from the moment you step out that this is not an area where you’re meant to be; the environment is rugged and uninviting, a sharp departure from the controlled spaces of the center.

The roof is largely barren, with only a few utilitarian elements scattered around. Aside from the expansive, open view of the surroundings, there’s little to see—just the harsh expanse of asphalt stretching out beneath the clear sky. This stark, utilitarian space is devoid of the amenities or comforts found elsewhere in the building.

As you exit the stairwell, you notice a camera mounted in a corner, its presence immediately noticeable as a small red light flickers to life. The camera’s activation is accompanied by the audible whirr of its zoom mechanism, as its arm moves with precise, mechanical efficiency to focus directly on you. The camera's movements are deliberate, tracking your presence with an unmistakable intent to monitor and record any unauthorized activity.

The overall atmosphere of the roof is one of stark, utilitarian surveillance, underscoring the fact that this is an off-limits area. The combination of the sticky asphalt, the watchful camera, and the glaring realization that you are not supposed to be here creates a palpable sense of both discomfort and vigilance. The roof serves as a stark reminder of the boundaries set by the center and the importance of adhering to them.
