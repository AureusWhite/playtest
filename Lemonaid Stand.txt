Aside from the art sales the appeal of a lemonaid stand draws people into this place, they don't force anyone to work it, people do for fun and to help pay their tuition as this is not a strictly government funded facility, good thing too.

If you step inside it's comfy and has real lemons precut in a small chest cooler and soda water on tap. If you stand here to long someone might ask for a lemonaid.
