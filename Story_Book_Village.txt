The Story Book Village is a whimsical and enchanting area designed to spark the imagination. Small, colorful cottages line the pathways,
each themed after a beloved fairy tale or nursery rhyme. The village is a perfect place for rejuves to immerse themselves in stories, 
role-play their favorite characters, and embark on magical adventures. Each cottage is equipped with costumes, props, and storybooks, 
creating a vibrant setting where creativity comes to life.
