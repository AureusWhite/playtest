A carocel of colors this room leads off into many differnet directions, green walls arrows and doors lead toward the common areas and dorms. Blue towards the laboratories and school rooms, the red side however features a green arrow leading out not an arrow leading in like the other two. 

in the center of the room stands a desk with a rather thin looking man sitting behind it his glasses nearly off his nose which is buried in a book. He seems to be writting as you walk in, and observes you for a moment anytime you touch or look at something and you hear a faint click.
