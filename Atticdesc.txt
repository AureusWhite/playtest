You find yourself in a narrow crawl space that, despite its primary function as a maintenance corridor, has just enough headroom for you to stand comfortably. The low ceiling is exposed, revealing a tangle of wooden rafters supporting the structure below. Between these beams, strips of pink insulation are stretched out like cozy blankets, offering a soft contrast to the rugged wooden framework. A small plywood catwalk runs the length of the attic, its surface worn but sturdy. This elevated pathway is dotted with access panels and tools, suggesting frequent use. Alongside the catwalk, you notice a series of inconspicuous cameras and other electronic fixtures, likely installed for surveillance and maintenance purposes. The air here is a mix of dusty warmth and the faint, chemical scent of insulation, lending a sense of both utility and secrecy to this hidden space.
