Hallway:

Welcome to the vibrant heart of our facility! This hallway is a burst of color, designed to guide our little rejuves through their daily adventures even if they can't tell time just yet.

The hallway features a series of brightly colored doors, each one indicating a different destination:

    Green Door: Located directly in front of you, this door opens without any locks or key card readers. It leads to the bathroom, nursery, and living room, offering easy access to these frequently used spaces.

    Blue Door: Just beyond the green door, this cheerful blue door leads you to the garden and the backyard. A colored key card reader at the top ensures only those with access can enter these outdoor areas, perfect for playtime and exploration.

    Red Door: At the end of the hall, the bold red door beckons. This door, equipped with a colored key card reader, leads to the garage and the attic, spaces reserved for special activities and storage.

Each door is a beacon, guiding our young rejuves to their destinations with ease and delight. The hallway itself is a canvas of colors, creating a lively and welcoming atmosphere where every step is an adventure.
