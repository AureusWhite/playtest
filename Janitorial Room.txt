You turned the knob to get in but as you stand inside, the door will not latch or close completely. A sensor detects if someone is in here. If left unheald the door will swing open quickly and might make noise. Still holding the door to keep it from banging open keeps you from the parts of the room further back, and thats where the cool stuff is. all thats reachable is a mop and broom, boring...
