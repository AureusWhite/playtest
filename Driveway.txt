Driveway: The driveway is a perilous place for rejuves, filled with potential dangers and lacking anything of interest. It's a big deal to get caught here, and for good reason. Mr. Yuck stickers are plastered on various items, warning of hidden hazards. The concrete stretches out in a barren, uninviting expanse, making it clear this is no place for play or exploration. Best to steer clear and stay safe!
