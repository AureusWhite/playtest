Attic: The attic is dark and dusty, it's clear that not many people come up here, the shelves are lined with dusty old equipment and toys from the centers earlier days. The floor creeks as you walk around and look and you can hear a faint mumbling of adult voices below you, can they hear you? 

Either way there are few things of intrest here, the center currently has better equipment and toys with better funding so anything found here, the one downstairs is better. IT might be interesting to see how the previous generations of rejuves spent their time here, and it's clear things where not as sophisticated then, the techology has evolved past the point where rejuves need to taken care of like babies.
